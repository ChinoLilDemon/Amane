** Scheduled features
Those features are not yet implemented and will come in future.
*** TODO Leveling
Leveling will be one of the core features of the bot.
The leveling system should make the texting in discord guilds make more appealing
*** TODO Moderation
Commands like ~ban~, ~kick~ and ~mute~ should be added since it, will be soon the only bot in the Aciralith Central discord.
*** TODO Logging
Logging commands and also edited/deleted messages will be pretty important, since we try to make the useage of different bots obsolete we have to include all features that others have.
*** TODO Reaction Roles
Making reaction roles is nowadays a musthave in discord and Amane should of course also have this feature.
*** TODO Enhancement of the Emote commands
We want to make the collection of nice gif commmands a lot more colorful.
*** TODO NSFW Commands
The NSFW Command collection that will include rule34, donbooru, realbooru, pornhub and others.
Guild admins will be able to disable this feature if it is displeasing.
*** TODO Disabling Unnecesarry Features
The staff of groups will be able to disable any features as they please.
*** TODO Music Commands
We don't know by now if music features will only include a broadcast or music for every user, but we will try to give a decent quality.
In any case this feature will only get into certified partners or servers of the Aciralith Network.
*** TODO Language Packs
We will integrate some nice language packs for other communities.
